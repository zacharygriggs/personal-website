                This tool can calculate what your grade will be in a class if you know what all your grades are, <br>
                as well as calculate what grade you need to receive on a specific assignment to get a desired <br>
                final grade in the class.<br><br>
                First, enter all known assignment scores and assignment weight into the fields. For assignment score,<br>
                you can either enter a percent grade (such as "80") or a score out of a total (such as "40/50").<br>
                For assignments you haven't taken yet, enter a question mark character ("?") to mark it as unknown.<br><br>
                Assignment weight is how much it counts for towards the total grade. For example if the final exam<br>
                is 30% of your grade, you should enter "30" as the weight for the final exam.<br><br>
                If you want to calculate what score you'll need on the unknown assignments to get a final grade in<br>
                the class, enter what grade you want in the "Desired Grade" field. This can also be either a percent<br>
                or a score out of a total. If you know all your grades, you don't have to enter a desired grade since<br>
                there are no unknown grades to calculate for.<br><br>
                Then press the Calculate and the tool will tell you what grade you need on the unknown assignments, or<br>
                what your known score is. You can enter multiple grades as unknown, but it will give you the unweighted<br>
                average you need on those assignments so it's recommended to only enter one unknown score for the best results.<br><br>
