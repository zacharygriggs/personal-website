                    <h3>Senior design</h3>
                    For school, I worked with two partners to create a senior design project. Our project was to create an Android Smartphone
                    app to automatically take photos of potentially-concerning skin lesions and perform analysis on them to find certain
                    metrics, like surface area, and whether it is symmetric or not.<br><br>
                    This app has a use-case for both doctors and patients; doctors could use it to quickly find hard-to-measure metrics like
                    surface area in order to help with tracking and diagnosing, and patients could track their skin lesions at home without
                    the need for a dermatologist appointment, which can have waiting times of several months.<br><br>
                    The app is not open source, but you can watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXNbYouva5w">video</a>
                    of how the app works, and see our <a href="resources/senior-design-poster.jpg">poster</a> that we presented
                    at the senior design show. This poster was printed on a large poster board<br><br>
                    On the technical side of things, we hosted the images (encrypted) on AWS S3. We stored user accounts (password hashed)
                    on AWS RDS in a MySQL database. The app was developed with Android Studio.<br><br>
                    I would several things differently with this project if I was creating it now with my currently knowledge. Ideally, the UI would be improved to require
                    fewer clicks to take/analyze photos, the image segmentation would be improved by doing post-processing of the photos,
                    and I would use services like AWS Cognito rather than writing my own login system.

                    <h3>Software Development Lab</h3>
                    In my Junior year at school, we had a class called software development lab, where we spent the year creating
                    some kind of useful application for the school or a company.<br><br>
                    Our group worked on a tool called MSOE About Time, which was capable of easily viewing hours worked per task and
                    hours worked per sprint on Jira. This tool already existed, so we added functionality to it and fixed some issues with it.<br><br>
                    My primary take-away from this project was learning to interact with external APIs that lacked documentation, and creating
                    maintaining a full stack Node application.<br><br>

                    new content using a modified version of the C language (called LPC) and provide general assistance to players.<br><br>
