    <h3 id="summary">AWS Service Summary</h3>

    <h4>This is a brief summary of AWS's most commonly used services.</h4>

    S3 (simple storage service). S3 provides serverless, extremely durable,
    cheap, and available storage.<br><br>

    Lambda is a serverless compute service. You can upload code to Lambda
    from a variety of languages and have it run when triggered by
    other AWS events.<br><br>

    DynamoDB is a NoSQL key/value store. Can create tables with a primary
    key (partition key) and a secondary primary key (sory key) and
    add data without need for schema.<br><br>

    EC2 is a remote server service. You can create an EC2 instance using
    specific operating systems and SSH into it and run code on it.<br><br>

    IAM (identity access management) manages who can access which resources.<br><br>

    RDS is a relational database service which can host instances of
    database servers. You can connect to the DB through JDBC connectors.<br><br>

    Redshift is a relational data-warehousing service. The difference
    between this and a database is that a data warehouse stores
    data for later analytics, where a database stores for use in transactions.<br>

    CloudFront sets up a content distribution network for other AWS
    resources so that it quickly distributes to many locations in the world<br><br>

    Route53 allows website domain name registration for extremely cheap,
    and then directing requests to other AWS hosting services<br><br>

    CloudWatch is a logging service that logs results from many other<br><br>
    services like Lambda.

    ElastiCache is an in-memory caching service that can improve the performance
    for apps with heavy workloads<br><br>

    API Gateway allows routing of HTTP request traffic to certain api endpoints
    such as Lambda, or your own API endpoint<br><br>

    X-Ray visualizes serverless apps by showing the steps of the app.<br><br>

    SQS (simple queueing service) allows for a cloud message queue. Messages can be places
    in the queue, and then polled from them. Guarantees messages are received at least once,
    but does not guarantee order by default - can be configured to be FIFO.<br><br>

    SNS (simple notification service) allows push notifications to various groups from the cloud.
    Subscription based and push based.<br><br>

    SES (simple e-mail service) allows sending e-mails from the cloud. This is not subscription based like SNS is.
    Push based.<br><br>

    Elastic Beanstalk allows simple deployment of web apps using things like node.js and docket.<br><br>

    Elastic Cloud Compute

    Alexa

    KMS

    Polly is Amazon's text-to-speech service.<br><br>

    <h3 id="concepts">Cloud Concepts</h3>

    <h4>Some of the terms critical to understanding the AWS platform</h4>

    The word "cloud" simply refers to running servers/code on someone else's
    hardware, rather than yours. For example, instead of running a database
    on your company's local hardware, you'd run it on AWS's hardware. The benefit
    of this is that AWS specializes in this kind of thing, which minimizes
    the cost, compared to building your own inhouse solution.<br><br>

    Availability refers to the amount of up-time of a specific service.
    High availability means that the service will almost always be running
    when you try to use it.<br><br>

    Durability refers to the data remaining the same as when you put it
    in the database. Highly durable data will be the same even when you
    use it years later. Low durability means the data may be corrupted<br><br>

    Realms are specific zones you can choose to run AWS services on.
    Some services go across all realms, some don't.
    Just always use US EAST 1 (N Virginia) unless you have a reason not to.<br><br>

    Multi-AZ refers to the trait of some services to spread data across
    multiple data centers for recovery. In this way, even if a data center
    gets destroyed, there will be other backups and your data remains safe.<br><br>

    Serverless refers to services which are highly abstract, to the point
    where you don't need to worry about what instance of server you
    are running, or where in the world you are running it. All you need
    to worry about is your code.<br><br>

    Edge locations refer to the positions in the world where AWS can be
    accessed. Generally major cities will be edge locations.
    Many edge locations minimizes latency.

    <h3 id="s3">S3 Specifics</h3>

    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    S3 is a simple file storage. Emphasis on simple. It is amazingly easy
    to use, and very low cost. On a personal level, it can be used as your
    backup drive (it will likely cost less than buying an external drive)
    You can also host websites very easily with it; all you need to do is
    upload an index.html and error.html.
    <h4>Structure</h4>
    Base-level "folders" are called Buckets. Each bucket must be UNIQUE among all
    users of S3, and has additional naming restrictions - for example, must
    be all lowercase.<br><br>

    Inside the buckets, you can place additional folders and files.
    Each file added will be represented as a "key" - a string which
    directly maps to this file in S3. S3 actually has no concept of
    folders inside buckets, it is just a visualization to make it easier
    for us. For example the key "myFolder/myFile.txt" is valid, and
    would be represented by a file called myFile.txt inside a folder, myFolder<br><br>

    A path to an S3 file would look something like this:
    S3://mybucketname/myFolder/myFile.txt<br><br>

    All files on S3 are private by default. They can be made public by
    first making the bucket public, then making each individual file
    public.

    <h4>Website hosting</h4>
    A bucket must be public to host a website. Hosting is quite simple.
    Just open the bucket, select Properties, open Static Website Hosting,
    enable Use This Bucket To Host A Website, and specify your index
    and error html files.

    <h4>Permissions</h4>
    In the Permissions tab of a bucket, you can specify a Policy to restrict
    or give access to the bucket. Additionally, CORS can be configured
    to allow cross-origin requests (i.e. allow someone else or another service
    to connect to and use s3) which is off by default.

    None of these permissions apply if the bucket is public, obviously.<br><br>

    <h3 id="lambda">Lambda Specifics</h3>

    <h4>Purpose</h4>

    Lambda is a serverless way to run code on the cloud. This service is highly abstract
    and allows you to run code without worrying about servers at all.<br><br>

    Lambda is extremely low cost, allowing 1 million requests before you start getting charged at all.
    After that, each million requests costs 20 cents.<br><br>

    Lambda scales out, meaning that each function is independent, so whether you run a million at
    the same time, or only one, the performance will still be very high. However it does not scale up -
    that is, you specify a memory usage amount and it will not exceed this memory usage.<br><br>

    Lambda response to events coming from various sources on Amazon, or can be called directly.

    <h4>Event sources</h4>

    The following services can trigger Lambda events:<br><br>
    - API Gateway<br>
    - IOT<br>
    - Alexa SKills Kit <br>
    - Alexa Smart Home<br>
    - CloudFront<br>
    - CloudWatch events<br>
    - CloudWatch Logs<br>
    - CodeCommit<br>
    - Cognito Sync Trigger<br>
    - DynamoDB<br>
    - Kinesis<br>
    - S3<br>
    - SNS<br>

    <h4>Supported languages</h4>

    You can write code directly into Lambda, upload code from your computer, or link code that is uploaded in S3.<br><br>

    You can use code from the following languages: Python, Java, C#, Go, and NodeJS. If using Java, you can upload a Jar containing the lambda handler.<br><br>

    <h4>Versions</h4>

    If you make a lambda function that works properly and you want to save it for future use without messing it up, you can save a version of this function.
    The default version is called $LATEST, and this is the only version that can be changed. If you publish another version, it cannot be changed at all.<br><br>

    You can link directly to this function to allow code to call the specific function version, or you can set up a redirect to
    path different traffic to different versions. You can split between two functions (and only two), but you cannot split between
    a specific version and $LATEST.<br><br>

    <h4>Debugging</h4>

    You can debug a Lambda function by using AWS CloudWatch to view the events, which will report the logs from the event to you,
    and you can also use AWS X-RAY which is a service used to debug serverless applications. When X-RAY is used, it will
    visualize the serverless application as a step function.

    <h3 id="dynamo">DynamoDB Specifics</h3>

    eventually consistent (within 1 sec), strongly consistent
    read capacity units (4x), write capacity units (1x), or allows double that for eventually consistent.
    DAX dynamodb accelerator, 10x read speed by caching, eventually consistent.
    ACID
    TTL: time before marked for deletion
    Cache can lead to stale data, write-through costs more but no stale data
    backed up by ssd
    spread through 3 datacenters
    iam permissions work on this
    indecies speed up queries

    local secondary: made when creating table, no modifications. same partition key, diffrent sort key.
    global secondary: whenever you want, edit it, different partition/sort key.
    scanIndexForward determines query order
    scan dumps all data then filters it using projection expression, slow.
    query/batchget is more efficient
    set small page size for less impact from scan/query
    scan returns 1mb at a time
    query searches using primary key only



    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    DynamoDB is a No-SQL database. It does not enforce a specific schema to add data to it. The only required parts are the
    partition key and (if desired), a sort key. These are essentially the primary keys and can be selected on.<br><br>

    <h4></h4>

    
    <hr>


    <h3 id="ec2">EC2 Specifics</h3>

    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    EC2 is a service to host servers, without worrying about the actual hardware
    details, and at highly flexible prices. The things you can do with EC2
    are highly varied, since it is just an instance of an operating system running.
    Linux is the most common system available, but there are others as well.
    The servers are protected by a key pair, which is needed to SSH into it.

    <h4>Pricing</h4>
    One of the most interesting things about EC2 is the pricing model. This really
    lets you optimize cost for your use case. Here are the pricing models and
    some use cases.<br><br>

    1: On-Demand. Reserve an instance when you need it, and pay for what you use.
    Much more expensive per hour, but you're not locked into anything. An example
    would be, a job that needs to run every day at 5 PM. Reserve for however long
    it needs to take, then tear down. Or, if you are trying to determine whether
    EC2 is worth it and you just want to give it a try.<br><br>

    2: Spot. An unusual pricing model, where you tell Amazon your maximum price
    you want to pay for an instance, and the instance is automatically reserved
    when the price falls below your max price. Like bidding. Prices of instances
    drop off at off-hours like late night when many people aren't using them.
    A possible use case is a data consumption job that should probably run once
    per day but it doesn't matter when it runs, and missing a day or two is no
    big deal.<br><br>

    3: Reserved. This would be considered the "normal" pricing model in other
    places. You pay for a server contract for some time (maybe a year). The
    hourly price is discounted heavily from on-demand, but you are locked
    into it. A use case would be hosting a static website through EC2. You
    never want it to go down, so you would want a contract-based model.<br><br>

    4: Dedicated host. This one has very specific use cases, you will probably
    never need to use it unless you fall under this case. A dedicated host
    guarantees they will not mix in your hardware server with other servers.
    Otherwise, it's like reserved. This is for people who fall under government
    regulations on their data, like medical institutions that fall under HIPAA.

    <h4>EBS</h4>
    EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a service within EC2. EBS allows for data storage on
    persistent SSD or magnetic disk drives, much like they are stored on our
    computers. You can choose a type of disk that is optimized for your workload.<br><br>

    SSD:<br>

    1: General purpose. Designed for systems with less than 10,000 input/output operations per second (IOPS)<br>

    2: Provisioned IOPS. Designed for systems with more than 10,000 IOPS.<br>

    Magnetic:<br>

    1: Throughput optimized. Provides low cost for a high amount of data access.<br>

    2: Cold HDD. Designed for data that is not accessed very much.<br>

    3: Bootable magnetic. The only drive here that you can boot from. It's old and not recommended.<br>

    <h4>Load balancers</h4>

    Elastic Load Balancer is another service that applies to EC2. There are two kinds of load balancers; application,
    and network.<br><br>

    Application load balancers help redirect HTTP traffic. It can distribute this
    HTTP traffic across multiple services, such as EC2 or Lambda. This helps route traffic
    to the intended destination<br><br>

    For an app load balancer redirection, an error or 504 tells that the app cannot scale to the level needed.
    The x-forwarded-for header shows the public IP that requested the resource.

    Network load balancing exists to increase performance, and it operates on the Network layer, such
    as TCP/UDP. This routes traffic between different private clouds and has extremely low latency.

    <h3 id="iam">IAM Specifics</h3>

    least access principle
    one key/pair per dev. cant see secret after creation time.
    role: universal, can attach to things like ec2.
    need to open port 3306 in security group to allow rds to talk to ec2.
    policies store specific permissions
    role is kind of like a user with no credentials that can be reused
    can attach policies to roles
    integrates with various login systems
