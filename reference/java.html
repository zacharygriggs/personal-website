    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

    Java is a very high level language. Java is contained in .java source files, each of which should contain
    one top-level class. All java code must be in a class, and inside the class, the code you want to run
    should be placed in the main method:
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ... code here ...
}
    </code>
    </pre>
    The main method should create and use other classes as needed. Classes are created by a constructor:
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
public class MyClass { // class declaration
    public MyClass() { // class constructor
        ... code here ...
    }
}</code>
    </pre>
    And to call this constructor:
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
MyClass c = new MyClass();
    </code>
    </pre>
    When compiled, java code will be built into .class files. This contains the optimized java code of the program.
    Then it can be compiled into a .jar. A .jar is a runnable version of the entire java program, and can be executed
    by the java -jar command in the command line.<br><br>
    When a java program is ran, it will be converted to bytecode and the bytecode interpreted by the JVM. The Java Virtual
    Machine is a program that runs on your computer and can interpret code from java bytecode to operating-system specific
    code. This ensures that the program will run essentially the same on any operating system you use to run it.

    <h3 id="primitive-types">Primitive Types</h3>

    These are the available primitive data types in Java. Primitives do not have methods associated with
    them, and are simple data stores. They do not store a reference in memory, but rather the actual value being stored.<br>
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        int (stores whole numbers, -2.14billion to 2.14billion)
        double (stores decimal numbers)
        char (stores single characters, for example 'A', 'B')
        boolean (stores either true or false)
        long (like an int, but stores numbers of higher magnitude)
        float (like a double, but less precise)
        short (like an int, but stores numbers of lower magnitude)
        byte (stores a single byte, which is 8 bits of data, or a number up to 255)</code>
    </pre>

    <hr>
    <h3 id="common-objects">Common Objects and Classes</h3>

    These are some Java classes that you will frequently use, especially in beginner-level java code. In Java, when an
    object
    variable is defined, the variable stores a reference, which redirects to the actual object in memory.<br>
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        String (holds words, for example "Hello, this is a string!")
        Scanner (used to take in user input)
        Random (used to generate random numbers)
        Math (static class used to perform more difficult math operations)</code>
    </pre>

    <hr>
    <h3 id="basic-io">Basic I/O</h3>

    In this case, Output is displaying messages or data to the user and Input is receiving messages or data from the
    user.<br>
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        // output
        System.out.println("Hello world!"); // display a message to user via command line
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "hello world!"); // display a message via pop-up

        // input
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        String userInput = in.nextLine();</code>
    </pre>
    Note: nextLine() is generally preferred due to unexpected behavior regarding the new-line character with other
    next methods. Such as nextInt() can accidentally interpret the newline character as part of the int and throw
    an exception. I always use nextLine() and then convert the result to the data-type I want.

    <hr>
    <h3 id="conversions">Converting between types</h3>

    When the program is converting from a small data type to a large data type (such as int to long), then the
    conversion will happen
    automatically because no data would be lost by the conversion. This is called implicit conversion.<br>
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        int x = 5;
        long y = x;</code>
    </pre>
    When we're going the other way, it would be possible to lose data. For example, if we have a long that is larger
    than the
    maximum value of an int, then the int would not be able to store it if converted. For this reason, we have to make
    an explicit cast. This makes the compiler know that we actually want to convert it and we know the consequences of
    converting it.
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        long x = 5;
        int y = (int)x;</code>
    </pre>
    Explicit casting is done by placing the data type you wish to convert for, in parenthesis, immediately before the
    value
    that we are converting. In the example above, we convert x into (int) and store it into the variable y.<br><br>
    Another example is converting int and double. Double stores decimal places (in other words: more data), so going
    from int to double
    is fine. Going from double to int loses the decimal places, so it must be done explicitly, and at the risk of losing
    information if
    the decimal part is meaningful.<br><br>
    The exception to this is converting a String into a numeric data type. In this case, use the following methods:
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        String myString = "5"; // declare string
        int numString = Integer.parseInt(myString); // use the string as an int
        double doubleString = Double.parseDouble(myString); // use the string as a double.</code>
    </pre>

    <hr>
    <h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>

    Comments are lines of code that will not be executed. There are three general formats:<br>
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        // single line comment

        /*  multi
            line
        */  comment

        /**
          * javadoc comments
          * these appear before methods and classes, summarizing the purpose of it
          */ and documenting any parameters or return values.</code>
    </pre>

    <hr>
    <h3 id="math">Math</h3>

    Simple arithmetic operations will be performed by Java.<br>
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        addition (+)
        subtraction (-)
        multiplication (*)
        division (/)
        modulus(%)</code>
    </pre>
    Take note of what is NOT supported. The carrot symbol (^) does not perform a power operation. Instead this will
    perform Bitwise XOR which will compile, but absolutely will not perform what you want it to.<br><br>
    Math can be performed on variables or constant values. For example:
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        int x = 2 + 2; // evaluates to 4.
        int y = x + 2; // evaluates to 6.
        int z = x + y; // evaluates to 10.</code>
    </pre>
    Beware of the so-called "integer division". When dividing two integers, the remainder will be IGNORED.
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        int x = 5 / 2; // what does this evaluate to?
        // do you think it's 2.5 because 5/2 = 2.5?
        // if so, you fell for integer division.
        // 5 and 2 are integers, the division of them
        // will also be an integer and ints cannot store
        // decimals, so this evaluates to 2.

        double y = 5 / 2; // this still evaluates to 2
        // 5 is an int and 2 is an int, so the result will be an int
        // even though we convert and store it in a double.

        double z = (double)5 / 2; // now this divides a double by an int,
        // which gives the result of a double, so this will be 2.5.
        // when there are two different types of data, like int and double,
        // the result will be the type that stores more information.
        // in this case, double.</code>
    </pre>

    <h3 id="harder-math">Harder math</h3>

    The Math class contains many methods that can be used for more complex operations. Among the most useful are the
    power and square root methods. Additionally, even though it is a simple operator, the modulus operator
    may be difficult to understand. Modulus performs a standard division, and then stores the remainder as the result
    rather than the quotient.
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        double root = Math.sqrt(16); // evaluates to 4.
        double power = Math.pow(3, 2) // evaluates to 9. this is 3 to the power 2.
        double modulus = 5 % 2; //evaluates to 1. 5/2 gives 2 remainder 1, the remainder is taken as the result</code>
    </pre>

    <hr>
    <h3 id="if-statements">If statements</h3>

    Makes a decision based on some given condition. Syntax:<br>
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        if(condition) {
            //then actions
        } elseif (another condition) {
            //elseif actions
        } else {
            //else actions
        }</code>
    </pre>
    Example of how to use in code:
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); // prepare to get user input
        String inputString = in.nextLine(); // gets a line of input from user
        int myNum = Integer.parseInt(inputString); // convert entered line to a number

        if(myNum > 10) {
            System.out.println("Number was more than 10");
        } elseif (myNum < 5) {
            System.out.println("Number was less than 5");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number was between 5 and 10 (inclusive)");
        }</code>
    </pre>
    For comparison operators, use the following for numbers:
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        == (equals)
        != (not equals)
        &gt; (greater)
        &lt; (less)
        &gt;= (greater or equal)
        &lt;= (less or equal)
    </code>
    </pre>

    <hr>
    <h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>

    There are three formats of loops. For loops are useful for looping a specific number of times, while loops are useful
    for looping while a specific condition remains true, and do while loops are just like while loops, but they happen
    at least once, even if the condition is false to begin with.
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            // code here happens 10 times
        {

        while(n == 10) {
            // code here happens as long as n = 10.
        }

        do {
            // code here happens at least once, and then as long as n = 10
        } while (n == 10)</code>
    </pre>
    There's also a special type of for loop called a for-each loop, which can loop over object that contain other objects.
    For example, Lists.

    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        for(String s : myList) {
            // in here, you can use "s" as a string, where s will iterate through all strings in the list.
        }</code>
    </pre>

    <hr>
    <h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>

    Arrays are like variables, except they store multiple values instead of one value.
    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        String[] sArray = new String[5]; // a string array that contains 5 elements
        sArray[0] = "hello"; // sets the first element of the array to hello. Arrays start at 0
        sArray[4] = "world"; // sets the last element of the array to world. Arrays end at length-1
        int len = sArray.length; // sets len to 5. All arrays have a property called length.</code>
    </pre>

    Lists are very similar to arrays, except they can increase in size. Arrays can not increase in size unless they are
    re-allocated completely. Lists also have methods that make it easier to use, rather than just acting as a
    typical variable.<br><br>
    List is the interface type, so you should declare with the List class to have it as abstract as possible,
    but you'll need to instantiate with one of the subclasses: generally either ArrayList or LinkedList.<br><br>
    What I have found is that you should always use ArrayList unless you are implementing some specific
    kind of data structure that uses LinkedList efficiently, like a queue or a stack.

    <pre class="highlight"><code>
        List&lt;String&gt; myList = new ArrayList<>;
        myList.add("word1");
        myList.add("word2");
        myList.add("word3");

        int len = myList.size(); // returns 3, because there are 3 items
        String firstWord = myList.get(0); // returns "word1", the first item
        String lastWord = myList.get(2); // returns "word3", the last word

        myList.remove(1); // remove the middle element
        // See the full javadoc of what you can do:
        // https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html
    </code>
