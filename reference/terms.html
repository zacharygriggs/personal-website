High-level languages: abstract languages where you do not need to worry about
the underlying hardware or managing memory. For example, Java.<br><br>

Low-level languages: a language that is close to the hardware and where the
programmer has to manage things like memory or registers. Assembly is one
of the lowest level languages.<br><br>

Coupling: refers to how much two separate classes rely on the details of
one another. Think of this as: if I were to change this class, how many
other classes would I have to change? If classes only pass data between
each other, then changing the internal details shouldn't matter as long
as the data remains the same. However if they rely on using each other's
methods or variables, then changing those would affect other classes.
High amounts of coupling like this is generally a poor design choice.<br><br>

Cohesion: how much the methods and elements of a class belong together.
This is subjective, but try to keep every class to a single purpose, and
have all methods in the class serve this purpose. If something is very
out of place, then it may have poor cohesion. Particularly true if
you have one huge class that does everything; that is low cohesion.
High cohesion is generally a good design choice.<br><br>

    <h3 id="test">Testing</h3>

Unit testing: writing code to test other code. Specifically, unit tests
are for only one unit of code, generally considered to be a method.
In order to unit test, you can use a library like JUnit for Java, and write
a unit test for every public method you have.<br><br>

Code coverage: how much of the code is being tested by your unit test.
If your unit tests run every line of code in your project, you would have
a 100% code coverage. Higher code coverage is generally better though
sometimes it is not possible to get very high, depending on your codebase.<br><br>

Test Driven Development (TDD): a method of writing tests where you first create unit tests that
test the functionality you want from your code, and then you write the
code in order to pass those tests. There is debate over whether or not
this method contributes to making code and design better.<br><br>

Acceptance testing: testing against a specific set of requirements to
determine whether the entire system satisfies the client's needs.

    Concepts of OOP: <br><br>
Encapsulation: encapsulated code is code that hides the internal details
of how it works from other classes. The classes that use it don't need
to see the internal details, so they are kept hidden and instead
communicate through well-defined public methods. In practice, this means:
keep all your variables and methods private unless they need to be public.<br><br>

Abstraction: code should not necessarily be tied to any implementation of
methods. That is, the method declarations should be enough to say what
the class is going to do, and the implementation of the contract can be
left to each consumer of the code. An example of this in Java is the List
interface. The List interface tells what each method should do, but not how
it needs to do it. The "how" aspect is left to the implementations, such as
ArrayList or LinkedList.<br><br>

Inheritance: a class should be able to be a specific kind of another class.
The classic example is: assume we have an "Animal" class. We should then
be able to create a "Dog" and "Cat" class that is a type of Animal. In
Java, this is done by extension. A class can Extend another class, which
makes a relationship of a class being a type of another class. For example
a Cat IS-AN Animal. That means it can do everything an Animal can, plus
specific other methods as decided.<br><br>

Polymorphism: the most complex of the OOP traits. Polymorphism states that when
inheritance is used, the compiler must figure out and call the most specific
version of all methods being used. Going back to the inheritance example,
if Animal has a makeSound() method, and Cat has a makeSound() method, then the
following function call:<br><br>

    <pre class="highlight"><code>
Animal a = new Cat();
a.makeSound();</code>
    </pre>


This must call Cat's makeSound() method, not Animal's.<br><br>

OOP: A language is considered object oriented if it has the four above traits.<br><br>
1: Allows encapsulation of classes.
Java accomplishes by having private modifiers.<br><br>

2: Allows for abstraction of objects.
Java accomlishes with abstract classes and interfaces.<br><br>

3: Allows for inheritance of classes.
Java accomplishes by the extends keyword.<br><br>

4: Implements polymorphism for classes.
Java does implement this feature.<br><br>
